# This Makefile allows you to write your Javascript in separate files and then
# glue it together using the C preprocessor.
#
# Source Javascript files end in .js.  These are built into a Javascript file
# with the suffix .jso ("Javascript object file") using this Makefile.  It's a
# bad idea to edit .jso files as your edits will be destroyed the next time
# make is run.
#
# To prevent issues with including the same file multiple times, each .js that's
# included by another needs to have #ifndef/#define/#endifs guards around it, just
# like in C or C++ headers.  Please see any of the .js files for examples.
#
# By convention, the top-level .js files, files that are never included by
# others, are only found in the js/ subdirectory, and all other files are found
# within the js/swirly/ subdirectory.  The .jso files all end up in the top
# directory, with any Max files.

PREPROCESS=gcc -E -P -C -x c -I. -I..
# -E means stop after preprocessing.
# -P means don't generate line markers (which confuse Javascript).
# -C means not to discard comments.
# -x c means treat the file as C code.

# The path to the Max For Live MIDI effect directory, relative to a user's home
# directory - a place you're likely to want .jso files.

# A path your local directory.  You can also copy to other remote machines that
# are mounted by using "/Volumes/YourVolume/Users/$(USER)$(LIVE_PATH)"

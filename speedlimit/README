Speedlimit is a pure Javascript box like Max's speedlim except that it uses a
queue to avoid losing any of the data.

It's intended as a demonstration of some techniques in Javascript for Max.

Speedlimit.jso is automatically generated from the file js/speedlimit.js as well
as about a dozen other files within js/ using the Makefile in the top directory.
